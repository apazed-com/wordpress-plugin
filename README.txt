**About Apazed**
Hello! Welcome to Apazed, the easiest way for website owners to collect payments online. Our main goal is to help those without the development knowledge or the engineering team to start getting paid without any additional fees. You can upgrade to our paid [Pro plan](https://apazed.com/pricing?src=wp.org) if you need more advanced features, but we're not going to bait and switch you into upgrading. All the features you need to get started are available for you now and forever, for free! 

Here are the *free* features that Apazed and this WordPress plugin can provide. 

= YOUR BRAND =
**Fully Customizable**
Allow a seamless checkout by adding the look and feel of your brand to payments forms and checkout pages.

= SECURE CHECKOUTS =
**Stripe Checkout**
Stripe Checkout is a prebuilt, hosted payment page optimized for conversion. Whether you offer one-time purchases or ongoing subscriptions, use Checkout to easily and securely accept payments online.

= PURCHASE MULTIPLE ITEMS =
**Shopping Carts**
Carts enable your customers to buy more of your products in a single purchase. We are really excited for the future of Carts. If you promise not to tell anyone, our plans involve building an experience that will take you to the moon.

= RECURRING PAYMENT OPTIONS =
**Subscription Payments**
Setting up recurring payments for your online course, non-profit, or goods and services is easy with Apazed. Select from pre-defined terms: daily, weekly, monthly, every 3 months, every 6 months, yearly, or custom. Custom terms can be based on days, weeks, or years.

= SIMPLE PAYMENT LINKS =
**Direct to Checkout**
Link customers directly to checkout. Links can be combined with other payment forms on the same page, allowing for improved conversions.

= NO SHORTCODES =
**Block Editor Support**
Add payments forms to your pages, posts, and other post types that use the Gutenberg editor. No need to fiddle with shortcodes, or customize your theme. 


== Features Soon to be Released ==

= STRIPE ELEMENTS =
**On-site Payment Forms**
Bring secure payment forms directly to your website—no more redirecting your users away. Your customers will be able to input their information quickly and correctly, minimizing user error and increasing the number of successful payments.

= ZAP IT =
**Integrate with Zapier**
Worried about data not being available for other software? Integrate with over 3,000 other apps around the web, including QuickBooks Online and Slack.

= EMAIL MARKETING =
**Capture Emails First**
Collect a customer's email address before they start the checkout process. Coupled with Zapier, these emails can be sent directly to your marketing services, or simply download them in CSV from Apazed.

= YOUR TERMS & POLICIES =
**Terms Approval**
Require your terms and policies to be approved before the customer can proceed to checkout. This is just another way to help you and your business succeed.

= SAVE CARDS =
**Charge a Saved Card**
Customers can safely and securely save their credit card information for future billing to save time with future purchases. This feature is perfect for receiving full payment after a deposit was made on a project.

Our Standard plan is free forever, but we think these Pro features are simply awesome. See our Pricing for more info.
